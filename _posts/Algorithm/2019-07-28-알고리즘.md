# REST API

The REST API consists of methods , resources, and messages.<br>
For example, when you have an example of "Call a method that takes jjongwuner as a user"<br>
`The act is called the method.`, 
`User is a resource.`, 
`jjongwuner is a user message.`
<br><br>

## **Exercise :**

```
{
   "user" : {
          "name" : "jjongwuner"
    }
}
```

## HTTP Method(CRUD)

| Method | Mean         | IdemPotent |
| ------ | ------------ | ---------- |
| Post   | Create       | No         |
| GET    | Select(Read) | YES        |
| PUT    | Update       | YES        |
| DELETE | Delete       | YES        |

## REST's Resource

jjongwuner is a user message. 
REST is a `resource-oriented` architecture style, so all definitions are expressed in nouns (method invocation, push, etc.) 

If you define a resource type called user as 
``http://myweb/users`` a resource with an id of jjongwuner is `http://myweb/users /jjongwuner.` As mentioned above, there may be confusion when defining command-oriented APIs. 

**Ex**. 
"Send a push message" is usually an existing  **RPC (Remote Procedure Call)** or a functional approach. It can be wrongly defined as `/myweb/sendpush`, but if you define it as a verb -> noun, It is a little easier to express. If you change the definition to "Create a push message request". 
**API Format:** `POST/myweb/push`. It is the design of REST type to be defined as resource type based noun form. 

**Ex.** Simple User Creation API HTTP Post, 

```
http://myweb/users/{ 
      "name": "jjongwuner",
      "address": "seoul" 
}
```
